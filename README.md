# SmartDoorLock
Implemented a door lock controller system in Java with functionalities for managing tenants, access logs, and door locking mechanisms.
The system allows adding and removing tenants, logging access events with timestamps, and controlling door access based on PIN input.
Utilized object-oriented principles, including encapsulation and inheritance, to create modular and maintainable code.
